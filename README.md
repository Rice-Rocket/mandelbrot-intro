# A Gentle Introduction Into The Mandelbrot Set

## Description

This serves as a gentle introduction to both Rust and the worlderful world of fractal rendering.
The current branch (l3_transforms) provides an implementation of a Mandelbrot set renderer which includes the ability to zoom into the set at an arbitrary location, on top of supporting basic coloring.
For more complex upgrades, you can visit the other branches.
