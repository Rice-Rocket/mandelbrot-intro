# A Gentle Introduction Into The Mandelbrot Set

## Description

This serves as a gentle introduction to both Rust and the worlderful world of fractal rendering.
The current branch (l5_palettes) provides an implementation of a Mandelbrot set renderer which includes coloring based on orbit trapping and color palettes, on top of the ability to zoom into the set.
For more complex upgrades, you can visit the other branches.
